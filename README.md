# Hand-Gesture-Classification-Algorithm
These codes and datasets are part of my senior project of fabricate flexible EMG electrode using carbon-based conductive ink and Myoware preprocessor board, connected to the Arduino Nano BLE Sense 33 MCU. These codes, associated with Google Colab, allow us to build up classification model using TensorFlow that can be converted into  TensorFlowLite then upload to Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense to further perform as a gesture classifier.
